# Star Wars Game

Pick a character and fight against your opponents. A winning player must pick their characters wisely by first fighting an enemy with low Counter Attack Power. This will allow them to build up Attack Power and to take on enemies before they lose all of their Health Points. To win the game the player must defeat all opponents.
